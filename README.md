# metabolic_model_curation
Genome-scale metabolic models require manual curation to accurately simulate microbial physiology. This repository collects template scripts geared toward specific, common tasks in metabolic model curation.

These particular scripts are used to evaluate and genome-scale metabolic models generated from metagenome-assembled genomes, using the metaGEM pipeline: https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/metaGEM

Whenever possible, we use commands from the MEMOTE test suite: https://memote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Multi-species simulations use the spatiotemporal framework COMETS: https://github.com/segrelab/cometspy
